 <!-- THE SPOTIFY BUILD -->

1.  GENERAL SETUP

- <!-- Setup a new project on firebase for hosting, then head to spotify for developers to create a new app... copy the client ID figures after initial setup. Edit settings in spotify and redirect url to localhost/3000 -->

2. BUILDING THE LOGIN SCREEN

- <!-- This will include the spotify logo and a button which redirects users to the actual spotify login page. Spotify will then authorize user and redirect to the clone app... setup a spotify.js file to handle authentication, clientId that was saved, and redirecting. -->

- <!-- In spotify.js, setup some code to handle permissions, as well as a function to get the token from url when users have been redirected back to the localhost -->

- <!-- Install spotify web api with npm i spotify-web-api-js, then import in App.js -->
